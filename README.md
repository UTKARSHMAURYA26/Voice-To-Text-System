# Voice-to-Text Converter

Welcome to the Voice-to-Text Converter project! This Python script allows you to capture audio from your microphone and convert it into text using the SpeechRecognition library. It's a simple and practical tool for transcribing your spoken words into written text.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Voice-to-Text Converter, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Install Python if you haven't already. You can download Python from the official website: [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Install the required library using pip:

## Dependencies

The Voice-to-Text Converter relies on the SpeechRecognition library, which connects to Google's Web Speech API for speech recognition. Ensure you have an active internet connection while using this script.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the script to fit your needs. You can modify the error handling, add more recognition engines (e.g., Sphinx for offline recognition), or integrate it into your own projects.
